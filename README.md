# RSA-Algorithm
Write the unencrypted password value. ▪ Then, encrypt the value with the public portion of the password key certificate. Use the RSA algorithm,  and use PKCS #1.5 padding (not OAEP), and add the result to the encrypted stream. ▪ Convert the resulting encrypted byte array into a string using base64 encoding.
